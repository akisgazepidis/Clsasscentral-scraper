Web Scraping for Online Courses Information
-------------------------------------------

### Overview

This Python script is designed to scrape information about online courses from the Class Central website. The script utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML content and requests library to fetch web pages. The goal is to gather details about various online courses, including their names, links, languages, costs, certificate availability, duration, ratings, reviews, overview, and syllabus.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:

*   `requests`
*   `bs4` (BeautifulSoup)
*   `tqdm`
*   `numpy`
*   `pandas`
*   `json`
*   `datetime`
*   `scipy`

You can install these libraries using the following command:

bashCopy code

`pip install requests bs4 tqdm numpy pandas scipy`
  

### Notes

*   The script handles connection errors and prints a message when the response status is not 200.
*   Adjust the sleep durations based on your network speed to avoid rate limiting.
*   The resulting dataset can be further analyzed or exported to a CSV file for external use.
